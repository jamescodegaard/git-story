On the island of Walsherdamf, there lived an old man who loved his jumpsuits. He decided to go to town once every other day, and when he went to town, he loved to shop at the local flea market. Unfortunately, he often did not have money to spend...but he decided to shop, regardless. Instead, he made socializing and debuting new jumpsuits the main event of his shopping adventures.
